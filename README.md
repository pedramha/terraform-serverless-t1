A medium-sized company wants to offer car subscription to its clients. Everything is included in the subscription fee except for gas.

The company would like to minimise the costs and reduce management overhead of the infrastructure. They also might need to recruit external developers to help with development. They also want to be able to dynamically change the process with least overhead.
